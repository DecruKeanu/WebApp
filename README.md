# project-DecruKeanu

This project pareses data from an online API and displays it to the user. This project uses the modelview pattern. The API that has been used in this project is called the Hyrule-Compendium-API. This API has been chosen since it contains a lot of different datas. The project is able to show the items sorted by category in a overview window as well as show an item more in detail in a seperate window.

It is possible to switch to a local backup version for the data by changing ICompendiumRepository in OverviewVM to CompendiumLocalRepository. This data is more limited but works as intended.
