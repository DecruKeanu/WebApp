# project-DecruKeanu

This project uses the Hyrule-Compendium-API. The reason that this API is used is because it consist of a lot of data, fits the DAE profile and is possible to show in 2 windows. The finished project is able to show the items sorted by category in one window and when an item is pressed it is possible to show it with more information in another window.

You can change between local and online repository by changing ICompendiumRepository in OverviewVM to CompendiumApiRepository for online data and to CompendiumLocalRepository for offline data (which is more limited).
