This project parses data from an online API and displays it to the user. This project uses the modelview pattern. The API that has been used in this project is called the Hyrule-Compendium-API. This API has been chosen since it contains a lot of different data. The project is able to show this data sorted by category in a overview window as well as show a data entry in detail in a detail window.

It is possible to switch to a local backup versio by changing ICompendiumRepository in OverviewVM to CompendiumLocalRepository. This data is more limited but works as intended.
